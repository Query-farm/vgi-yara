# Dispatch the single vgi-yara image into one of its transports:
#   http   (default) the HTTP server on $PORT (8000), bound 0.0.0.0 so a
#                    published host port reaches it. Serves /health.
#   tcp              raw Arrow-IPC over TCP on $PORT_TCP (8001), bound 0.0.0.0.
#                    Used by the VGI extension's transparently-shared container.
#   stdio            a worker DuckDB spawns over stdio (on-host execution).
# Any other first argument is exec'd verbatim (escape hatch for debugging).
#
# The worker is stateless (YARA-X engine compiled in, rules supplied per query),
# so there is no /data to create and no state env to wire — each mode just
# exec's the binary.
