# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-yara
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.
#
# Parameterized by TRANSPORT (default: subprocess), exercising the SAME suite
# over each transport the vgi extension supports — the only thing that changes
# is what LOCATION (VGI_YARA_WORKER) the .test files ATTACH:
#
#   subprocess  VGI_YARA_WORKER = the stdio worker command (DuckDB spawns it).
#   http        start `yara-worker --http` (auto port; advertises `PORT:<n>`
#               on stdout), VGI_YARA_WORKER = http://127.0.0.1:<port>.
#               If VGI_YARA_WORKER is ALREADY set to an http(s):// URL (e.g. a
#               pre-launched container in the docker image_test), it is used
#               as-is and no local worker is spawned.
#   unix        start `yara-worker --unix <sock>` (advertises `UNIX:<sock>`
#               on stdout), VGI_YARA_WORKER = unix://<sock>.
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST  path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   WORKER_BIN        path to the compiled yara-worker binary (used to launch
#                     the http/unix servers, and the stdio LOCATION). Falls back
#                     to VGI_YARA_WORKER when that is a bare command (subprocess).
# Optional:
#   TRANSPORT         subprocess | http | unix   (default: subprocess)
#   STAGE             scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
#   TEST_PATTERN      runner glob/path under the staged tree to execute
#                     (default: test/sql/*). All files are always staged; this
#                     only narrows what RUNS — e.g. a single-file stdio smoke.
