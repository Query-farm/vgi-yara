# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.

# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST  path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   VGI_YARA_WORKER  worker LOCATION the .test files attach (a stdio command
#                     such as the compiled yara-worker binary, or an http:// URL)
# Optional:
#   STAGE             scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
